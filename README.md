**String Comparator**

String Comparator is a simple web application that allows users to compare two strings and visualize the differences between them. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input two strings, click the "Compare" button, and instantly see the highlighted changes between the two strings. The highlighting follows the conventions similar to those used in popular version control systems like Git.

Features:

* Compare two strings side by side
* Highlight the differences between the strings
* Enable/disable editing of the input strings
* Clear all text fields with a single click

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the diff_match_patch library used for string comparison and highlighting. It's a handy tool for developers, writers, and anyone else who needs to compare strings quickly and easily.
